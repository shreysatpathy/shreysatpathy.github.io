          <h2>Can LLM agents simulate the world?</h2>
          <p class="date">Published: June 15, 2025</p>

          <p>I've been playing with agentic IDEs for a while now, and they're amazing for spinning up quick web apps and CRUD interfaces. But I started wondering - could they handle complex numerical analysis software? You know, the kind where one incorrect pointer dereference sends you spiraling into debugging hell for hours.</p>

          <p>I've always had a fascination for simulation of interactions in the world - boiling, flows, plasmas, etc. If you can simulate it, you can optimize it. With all these advanced is LLM assisted coding, can I build any simulation environment and model some physics without much effort? 
          </p>
          
          <h3>Challenge 1: Simple World Simulation</h3>
          <p>For the first task I decided to build a reinforcement learning system to optimize tarmac operations at airports. I'm choosing this problem since it's sufficiently complex to model while providing value even in a simple 2D grid-world like simulation. If I can do this, then imagine what a skilled expert building Navier-Stokes solvers for their day job could do with these kinds of tools. </p>
            
          <p>Turns out moving airplanes around is surprisingly complicated, especially with uncertain schedules (Found some work from <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20210016168/downloads/20210016168_MJohnson_VertiportAtmtnConOpsRprt_final_corrected.pdf">NASA Ames on this</a>)! The core problem is that tugs need to shuffle planes around when another aircraft (often a private jet) unexpectedly calls in to land. Ultimately the airport operators need to optimize the schedules of these tugs and planes to minimize the number of moves necessary while parking the maximum number of planes that will buy fuel from the airport. These operate quite like a glorified gas station when you think about it.</p>

          <p>My approach is simple, breaking it down into three sub-problems:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a world model of the airport tarmac with all its constraints</li>
            <li>Build an interactive game where I can play as the tug operator (a fun side-quest)</li>
            <li>Generate random arrival and departure schedules and implement an RL loop to learn the optimal tug policy</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Simple enough.</p>

          <p>So far we have a simple world model and interactive game where I can play as the tug and move planes around. I've also implemented a simple Deep Q-Learning agent to learn the optimal tug policy. Lot's of reward shaping still needed but it's learning something!

          <h3>Challenge 2: Simple physics</h3>
          <p>While Newtonian dynamics has largely allowed us to solve most macroscopic collision interactions, can I just ask an llm agent to write code to simulate a simple interaction. I gave it the vaguest of prompts - Simulate a bouncing ball in a Rotating pendulum. </p>

          <p>Here's the output: </p>

          <div class="game-container" style="width: 100%; min-height: 700px; margin: 20px 0; position: relative;">
            <iframe src="../projects/bouncingBallGame/index.html" width="100%" height="700px" style="border: none; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); resize: both; overflow: hidden;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <div style="text-align: right; font-size: 12px; color: #888; margin-top: 5px;">↘️ Drag the bottom-right corner to resize</div>
          </div>

          <p>Pretty impressive! We have a complete physics simulation with gravity, air resistance, collision detection, and energy conservation. You can interact with the simulation by clicking inside the hexagon to place the ball and adjust various parameters using the sliders.</p>

          <p>Okay great! But would you trust this <i>simulator</i> to design a lunar landar? </p>

          <p>Verification is the problem!</p>

          <h3>Challenge 3: Finite Element Simulation of a multi-phase flow problem</h3>

          <p>For this challenge I wanted to go back to a simpler time, a time when I was an eager graduate student in the Multi-phase Flow lab at NC State hanging out in the old reactor bay dungeons of <a href="https://nrp.ne.ncsu.edu/about/history/">Burlington Nuclear labs</a> studying the flow dynamics inside the core of Pressurized Light Water Reactors. Solving a coupled system of Navier-Stokes equations with heat transfer and phase change would take a skilled graduate student months of work. <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/">OpenFoam</a> was still around but a lot of the academic community was building on top of their existing solvers. My group back then used <a href="https://github.com/PHASTA/phasta">PHASTA</a> - Parallel Hierarchic Adaptive Stabilized Transient Analysis of compressible and incompressible Navier Stokes equations. Essentially a solver that's capabale of solving coupled partial differential equations (conservation of mass, momentum, energy, etc.) on a finite element mesh and do so in a highly parallelizable manner (typically on supercomputers).</p>
          
          <p>I started with my coding agent in chat mode to see what solvers are currently out there that I can use. OpenFoam continues to dominate the space and since it's open source I assume the frontier models have already scooped it up during pre-training. OpenFoam also has models that approximate the physics of turbulence and heat transfer which allows us to simulate these phenomenon on my 16 cpu local machine (As opposed to PHASTA where any meaningful simulation would require a supercomputer like <a href="https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-resources/mira">Mira</a>). 
            
          In 15 minutes or so, I finalized a basic simulation design, mesh, initial conditions, boundary conditions etc. and began implementing in agent mode. </p>   

          <p> In a few hours, this is what I have:</p>

          <div class="video-container" style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 30px 0;">
            <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRTpt-B3gio?si=SYXx4YBiEZeY7mty" title="OpenFOAM Simulation" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

          <p>So turns out - yes, software agents can indeed simulate the world - Using our existing state of the art solvers. For this simulation I wanted to start with a cylindrical water tank with heat being applied from the bottom. The simulation starts with the cylinder of water redistributing in the container and then boiling off, primarily from the corners. </p>

          <p><b>Case Parameters</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Domain geometry: 10cm × 10cm × 10cm cubic heated pool</li>
            <li>Grid resolution: 40 × 40 × 40 cells (64,000 total)</li>
            <li>Initial temperature: 25°C (298.15 K)</li>
            <li>Heat source: 50,000 K/m thermal gradient from bottom wall</li>
            <li>Pool configuration: 5cm water height, 5cm vapor space above</li>
            <li>Solver: compressibleVoF with thermal phase change</li>
            <li>Simulation time: 0.0s to 1.0s with adaptive time stepping</li>
            <li>Parallel processing: 8-core decomposition for enhanced performance</li>
          </ul>
            
          <p><b>Physical Models</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Two-phase flow: Water (liquid) and air/steam (gas)</li>
            <li>Phase change: Lee model for evaporation/condensation</li>
            <li>Turbulence: k-ε RANS model for both phases</li>
            <li>Heat transfer: Full energy equation with conduction and convection</li>
            <li>Surface tension: 0.0728 N/m (water-air interface)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Everything from the mesh generation, to implementing the boundary conditions I asked for, to setting up the visualization environment in paraview was done by the agent with me supervising. There was a part of my Sunday afternoon where I sent the agent to go run a few iterations and check whether things were working as expected. While the agent was hard at work I had to go clean up the mess in the living room made by our pup. The experience made be reflect on the surreal future we find ourselves living in. </p>
