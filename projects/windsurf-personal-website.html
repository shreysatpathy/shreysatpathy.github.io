          <h2>Using Windsurf to Create and Update My Personal Website</h2>
          <p class="date">Published: June 15, 2025</p>

          <p>One morning I woke up and decide to refresh my personal website. After losing access to my past github account and therefore my last github pages website: https://ssatpat.github.io/, I realized it's high time I put myself out there again.</p>

          <p>I've been playing around with using agentic IDEs for a while now, both for work and personal projects so I was pretty familiar with their limitations and powers. Building throw-away software has never been easier. But not all software is meant to be thrown away. Software once out there, must be maintained, monitored, improved.</p>

          <p>I decided to use windsurf to build out my personal website using github pages to host it because I didn't wanna pay the 5 bucks a month forever just to host this thing. I wanted to buid out the entire static webite stack using purely html, js and css - nothing complicated. I also needed a ci cd system to push updates to the website and make sure I dont break things.</p>

          <p>In a matter of hours I was able to build the basic website, cicd with github actions and had a live site up and running. I also created a simple about me section with my resume and work experience by just pointing windsurf to my linkedin page. It felt magical.</p>

          <p>And the output of this is the website you're reading this on. I will continue to iterate and improve this over time. I think currently it lacks my style and taste. Let's see how this will evolve over time.</p>
