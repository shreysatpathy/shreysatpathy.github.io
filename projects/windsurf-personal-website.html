          <h2>Using Windsurf to Create and Update My Personal Website</h2>
          <p class="date">Published: June 8, 2025</p>

          <p>One morning I woke up and decided to refresh my personal website. After losing access to my old GitHub account and my previous site (https://ssatpat.github.io/), it was time to get back online.</p>

          <p>I've been using agentic IDEs for both work and personal projects, so I know what they can and can't do. Building quick prototypes is easier than ever, but real websites need maintenance and updates over time.</p>

          <p>I chose Windsurf to build my site and GitHub Pages to host it (why pay monthly fees when you don't have to?). My plan was simple: create a clean static site with HTML, JS, and CSSâ€”nothing fancy. I also set up a CI/CD pipeline to make updates smooth and error-free.</p>

          <p>The results surprised me. In just a few hours, I had a working website with GitHub Actions handling deployments and a live site ready to go. Notice the added touch with the light/dark theme toggle. I didn't really ask for that but it's a nice touch. For my about section, I simply pointed Windsurf to my LinkedIn profile and it did the rest. What a wonderful time to build!</p>

          <p>And that's how this site came to be. I'll keep improving it as I go. Right now it's functional, but I want to add more of my personal style over time. Let's see how it evolves!</p>
