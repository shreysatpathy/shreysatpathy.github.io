          <p>Humans built a world of ones and zeros, and then layered abstractions on top of abstractions. Why? In my view, nearly all software falls into four fundamental categories of use.</p>

          <h3>1) Software that does math</h3>
          <p>From the earliest ballistic tables to orbital mechanics and cryptography, software has been a tool for computation. We used arrays of human computers to estimate trajectories and design nuclear weapons during the Manhattan Project, then mechanized and digitized that labor. This is the purest form of software: turning inputs into quantitative answers.</p>

          <h3>2) Software that brokers human interactions and Bookkeeping</h3>
          <p>Most of daily life runs on this. Texting my mother, Buying eggs, getting paid, scheduling deliveries, issuing tickets, verifying identity—systems that coordinate people and resources while keeping trustworthy records. Databases, ledgers, and workflows that make the real world legible and auditable.</p>

          <h3>3) Software for entertainment</h3>
          <p>Movies, music, games, social media, live sports streams. A vast stack exists purely to create and deliver experiences. It optimizes for attention, emotion, and presence rather than ledgers or equations.</p>

          <h3>4) Software for other software</h3>
          <p>Compilers, databases, operating systems, cloud platforms, CI/CD, agents, observability—an ever-growing layer built to serve, orchestrate, and improve other software. The metasoftware that makes the rest possible.</p>

          <p>A majority of humans use software every day without naming it as such, and what they touch typically falls into one or more of the first three categories. The fourth category is what keeps the lights on, so the rest can feel like magic.</p>
