          <p>I've been playing with AI coding agents since dark days of early 2023 and there's never been a better time to be instructing machines! :)</p>
          
          <p>From the early containers on href <a href="https://www.swebench.com/">SWEBench</a> to the hype around Devin and OpenDevin (Now <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands">OpenHands</a>) I saw the future of software unfolding in front of me. I knew this era of AI generated code would change the way we built and managed software - but exactly how is what I wanted to understand. For the first time in my life I feel like I have the skills to comprehend the frontier of this tech. I want to use this moment to forecast out a few years and place some bets.</p>
          
          <p>Check out my <a href="../projects/windsurf-personal-website.html">windsurf-personal-website</a> project to see how I used AI tools to build this site.</p>
          
          <h2>My bets for the future:</h2>
          
          <h3>1. The amorphous blob of application layer software</h3>
          <p>Software will become hyper-personalized to users and their specific problems. I see software development as an optimal control problem: you observe a problem, build something to address it, watch how users respond, and iterate toward a better solution. More parts of this cycle will become automated, making iterations faster. Will humans become obsolete? No. While AI will perfect verifiable tasks, product development isn't one of them. Product development is a complex game with incomplete and imperfect information where human taste, nuance, and experience will still matter most.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Software companies will consist of only decision makers</h3>
          <p>As productivity accelerates, routine tasks will be automated away. Humans will focus on what they do best - understanding customer problems and envisioning solutions. The execution details will increasingly be handled by AI systems.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Software will continue to eat the world</h3>
          <p>Marc Andreessen was right, and this trend is only accelerating. The IT backlog is so massive that our AI agents will be busy for decades helping humans solve real-world problems.</p>
          
          <h3>4. The world will focus on / invest in software that directly interacts with the physical world</h3>
          <p>Think about control systems, PLCs, SCADA, Robots (general purpose & specialized). Today the software serving this industry is often custom built and requires specialized knowledge - often with a legacy tech stack (they've got <a href="https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109955813/siemens-industrial-copilot-for-engineering?dti=0&lc=en-WW"> agents too now!</a>). I believe this stack will be <i>modernized</i> and AI assisted software engineering will only accelerate this.</p>
