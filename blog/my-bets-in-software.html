          <p>I've been playing with these AI coding agents from the early days of 2022 :)</p>
          
          <p>From babyAGI to the hype around devin I definitely saw the future of software unfolding in front of me. I knew this era of ai generated code would change the way we built and managed software - but exactly how is what I wanted to understand. For the first time in my life I felt like I had the skills to comprehend the frontier of this tech. I want to use this moment to forecast out a few years and place some bets.</p>
          
          <p>Checkout my previous project <a href="../projects/windsurf-personal-website.html">windsurf-personal-website</a> which talks through how the website you're currently reading this on came to be.</p>
          
          <h2>So what are my bets for the future:</h2>
          
          <h3>1. The amorphous blob of application layer software</h3>
          <p>Application layer software will be hyper-personalized to the user and problem at hand. I think of software development and delivery as an optimal control problem. You have an observation of a problem space, you make certain actions of software building in hopes to address the problem. Then you observe the response of your users and iterate continually to some asymptotically perfect solution. We will see parts of this control system getting more and more automated yielding faster iterations. So will humans be out of the loop? No, I believe all verifiable tasks will reach some level of perfection with ai systems. But I would argue that software product development is not a verifiable task. It's a n person game with partial and sometime incorrect information. This is where taste, nuance and the human experience will matter.</p>
          
          <h3>2. Software companies will consist of only decision makers</h3>
          <p>As we see human productivity continue to accelerate, all the mundane tasks of executing on a mission will be offloaded. Humans will still be required to ultimately be responsible for addressing customer problems with whatever software solution they can dream up.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Software will continue to eat the world</h3>
          <p>This is a reference to some Marc Andressen quote and I think this trajectory of software will continue. The IT backlog is massive enough to keep all our ai agents busy helping humans solve problems in the real world.</p>
