          <p>The need to track software projects has existed ever since humans started instructing machines.</p>

          <p>The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a lot more than the code - it's about the people, the processes, the feedback, the upgrades, the incidents. The code is just the beginning. As software begins interacting with the real world (users) it has a life of it's own. If your software becomes a critical part of your customer's business processes, the stakes become infinitely higher than a vibe-coded webapp.</p>

          <p>As more coding tasks (across the stack) begin delegated away to SWE-Agents, I as their product manager have a greater need to track and validate their work. The user experience for managing your small army of SWE-agents is lacking. Some efforts to manage this chaos are task lists - some tools build this into the experience while others work well with creating markdown files detailing tasks and asking SWE-agents to update the task-list as it accomplishes each unit of work. There are also Jira MCP integrations that in theory should allow me to track and enforce some processes on these SWE-agents.</p>

          <p>Personally at my day-job I wouldn't be considered a process-heavy PM. I build enough trust with my engineers that I trust them to deliver on our shared vision. However, I can't say the same about SWE-agents. I've found the need to be very structured in my instructions and processes when building using these agents. For example, "write a test based on the specification, and then implement the feature and make sure tests pass". SWE-agents feel magical, but (today) they still need a little babysitting.</p>

          <p>Tracking work during development is one thing, but once your software is out there, you will have an ever-growing backlog of improvements and bugs. Your users will always want more and your software will always have bugs (Halting problem). Therefore I need a tool to organize my backlog and prepared in a way that can easily be sent to SWE-agents to start implementing.</p>

          <p>Then there is the incident management and operational aspects of software systems. I desire a system where a software incident occurs at 3am, it's triaged by SRE-agents to bring the system back to functional. The root cause is determined by an SWE-Agent that has a deep understanding of your stack and code-base. Tasks to fix the bug are broken down and tracked appropriately for SWE-agents to make a PR. By the time I wake up around 5:30am I see that an incident occured last night, systems were operational in 5m and a new build with the bug fix was promoted to production by 3:30am.</p>

          <p>Why is tracking all this imporant? Ultimately we're serving customers with our software. If our software is not meeting their needs in any way (functionality, reliability, performance) I would like to know. Then I'd like to have the tools necessary to prioritize and tackle the improvements and bugs that best deliver customer value.</p>

          <p>Does Jira or similar tools (Linear, Trello etc.) meet the needs of software project management in the era of SWE-Agents? Maybe it's time for GoodJira.</p>
